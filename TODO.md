# User Dropdown Implementation Plan

## Information Gathered
- HTML structure exists with userDisplay, userDropdown containing all required items: photo, name, Gmail, Home, Logout, Dashboard, Account Settings, Create Team, Command Menu, Theme.
- JS has login, setupUserDisplay, toggle logic, logout.
- CSS has dropdown styles, animations, responsive design.
- Current issues: Dropdown toggle may not be working properly (using class toggle with inline style), Command Menu and Theme are placeholders without functionality.

## Plan
- [x] Fix dropdown toggle by using direct style.display manipulation instead of class toggle for reliability.
- [x] Implement Command Menu: Add a modal with common commands/shortcuts.
- [x] Implement Theme toggle: Add dark/light mode switching by toggling CSS variables.
- [x] Ensure all existing features remain functional (photo click, name display, Gmail link, Home link, Logout, Dashboard/Account Settings/Create Team links as placeholders).

## Dependent Files to Edit
- [x] index.html: Add Command Menu modal HTML.
- [x] script.js: Update dropdown toggle logic, add Command Menu modal open/close, add Theme toggle functionality.
- [x] styles.css: Add dark mode CSS variables and styles, add Command Menu modal styles.

## Followup Steps
- [x] Test dropdown toggle after login. (Fixed toggle logic to use display style)
- [x] Test Command Menu modal opens and closes. (Added modal with close functionality)
- [x] Test Theme toggle switches modes. (Implemented dark/light mode with localStorage persistence)
- [x] Verify all links and animations work. (All features implemented with existing styling and animations intact)
