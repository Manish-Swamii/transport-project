# Task: Add City Tags Properly in All Names

## Steps to Complete:

1. **Edit index.html**: Remove the extra 9th icon (fa-archway) and city name (Gurugram) from the "Online Truck Booking Across Top Cities" section to match the 8 cities in the image (Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Delhi NCR). [x] Completed
2. **Adjust Layout**: Fine-tune min-width and gap in the icons and names rows for a tighter horizontal banner layout matching the image. [x] Completed
3. **Verify Icons**: Ensure 8 generic orange Font Awesome icons are assigned appropriately (e.g., fa-landmark, fa-university, etc.) for the cities. [x] Completed
6. **Refine Icons**: Update icons to more representative landmarks for each city (e.g., fa-mountain for Pune, fa-bridge for Kolkata) and add title attributes for accessibility. [x] Completed
4. **Test Rendering**: Use browser to launch index.html and confirm the section displays as a compact horizontal row with icons above names, no wrapping. [x] Completed
5. **Update TODO.md**: Mark steps as completed after each one. [x] Completed
